            3D Virtual tours are hosted for up to 30 days free of charge from
            the date of upload, and are subject to a monthly subscription fee of
            $9.99 (plus applicable taxes and fees) per property thereafter upon
            ending the initial trial period. Users must submit a cancellation
            request through lovelyrealestatephotography.com/cancel to deactivate
            their 3D Virtual Tours and cancel the scheduled subscription
            payments. To avoid subscription payments completely, users must
            submit a cancellation request through
            lovelyrealestatephotography.com/cancel within the initial 30-day
            free trial. Users must submit a cancellation request within 7 days
            after being charged the subscription fee to be eligible for a refund
            for that month they were charged; otherwise, they will not be
            eligible for a refund. All 3D tour subscription payments exceeding 7
            days of the paid invoice cannot be refunded. 3D Virtual Tour hosting
            plans that have been canceled by any means will incur a reactivation
            fee of $79.99 + applicable taxes and fees should the client request
            for it to be reactivated.
          </p>
          <p>
            All photos must be downloaded from third-party links within 72 hours
            as they are subject to insolvency to ensure the availability of
            storage for all customers. Videos with music do not have licenses to
            the music and are at the sole discretion of the customer if they
            want to purchase the audio license. Music/audio used in any aspect
            of Lovely Real Estate Photography services are made only as an
            illustration to showcase the work and are not intended for
            advertising purposes. Lovely Real Estate Photography does not
            guarantee any information or content of the website is reliable or
            accurate. Floorplans created by Lovely Real Estate Photography are
            illustrations and do not exactly, accurately, or directly reflect
            the measurements of the properties, including but not limited to
            interior and exterior rooms, structures, additions, or other
            building-related components.

            Lovely Real Estate Photography does not guarantee that this website
            is free of viruses and/or attacks that can retrieve or use
            information to cause harm. Information is generally considered not
            secure and does not warranty any security. “Unlimited Photos” is
            subject to time constraints placed on the photographer during
            on-site visits. Photographers assigned to produce “Unlimited Photos”
            are capped to as many photos as they can take within the time
            constraint of 1 hour during their on-site visits. The number of
            photos produced by each photographer can vary. The time slots
            indicated on the website for each booking are not to be referenced
            as the time the photographer will conduct the photoshoot; it is
            merely a time window of when the photographer will arrive on site.
            The photoshoot process can take as little or as long of a time as
            the photographer needs to capture the necessary content.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a strict “No Refund Policy” due to the digital content
            redistribution nature of the business. The delivery of content to
            the client is completed digitally, which means that it runs the risk
            of clients receiving products/services that can be taken, stored,
            replicated, and used for personal/commercial use after the extensive
            work is completed by Lovely Real Estate Photography. Clients
            acknowledge that all services are completed upfront, and Lovely Real
            Estate Photography bears all the upfront costs. Lovely Real Estate
            Photography does not assume any obligation to refund money or
            services and holds the right to not conduct in any further exchanges
            with clients in the event of a dispute. Lovely Real Estate
            Photography holds the right to all the content that is produced and
            can do as they please, regardless of clients{"' "} requests. In the
            event that content is delivered to unsatisfied clients, Lovely Real
            Estate Photography will not remove any of its content to ensure
            sufficient evidence is available in the event of a dispute. Lovely
            Real Estate Photography does not warrant the quality of work of any
            photography, videography, or other services that are described. Once
            content is delivered to the client, it will remain in “as-is”
            condition unless there was an error made by Lovely Real Estate
            Photography, in which case it will be corrected through the change
            request process. Once content is delivered to the client, they have
            a maximum of three change requests they can email to the support
            desk to have changed, altered, or updated. Lovely Real Estate
            Photography holds the right to refuse work that exceeds the maximum
            number of change requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lovely Real Estate Photography produces content for each property
            based on the expenditure of content editing hours. Each property is
            subject to a maximum of eight hours of content editing. Lovely Real
            Estate Photography holds the right to refuse work that exceeds the
            maximum number of content editing hours, including but not limited
            to change requests. All aerial and drone services are conditional on
            having good weather at the location in which the photoshoot is
            taking place, including but not limited to having no rain, snow,
            hail, or other harsh weather that would cause damage to equipment.
            Lovely Real Estate Photography makes no guarantees on booking
            appointments on clear sunny weather conditions. Photos and videos
            will be taken regardless of weather conditions unless Lovely Real
            Estate Photography or its photographers specifically recommend not
            taking photos/videos due to increased risk of equipment damage. All
            digital content produced as part of the aerial and drone service is
            not refundable and will not be rescheduled unless additional fees
            pertaining to travel and penalties are paid.
          </p>
          <p>
            All appointments that are canceled and/or rescheduled on the same
            day of the appointment are considered “No-Show” appointments and are
            charged in full for the bundle type reserved in the given time slot
            of that booking. Same-day rescheduling only charges the client for
            the bundle price, and not the additional upgrades. Once content is
            delivered to clients, clients must assume the project to have
            expensed the maximum number of editing hours. Lovely Real Estate
            Photography photographers assigned to properties with amenities hold
            the right to refuse any and all work pertaining to amenities as it
            is outside of the general scope of work. The general scope of work
            in the standardized bundles includes the exterior structure of the
            building and interior of the individual unit and does not include
            any other areas of the building.
          </p>
          <p>
            All appointments made for outside of the regular service area must
            be paid in full prior to the appointment date. Regular service areas
            may vary depending on the Lovely Real Estate Photography location
            closest to the appointment; however, each location can service areas
            up to 100 km from their central office. In the event that the
            photographer arrives at the appointment location and the homeowner,
            real estate agent, or anyone involved in booking the appointment is
            not present at the property at the appointment time and/or does not
            want to continue the service, there will be no refunds/rebates or
            any form of payment issued to the client, and a $99.99 “no-show fee”
            will be applied to the payment on file.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lovely Real Estate Photography has a strict “No Pet Policy” which
            means that there should be no pets present on-site at the property
            in which the photoshoot or appointment is taking place. Any and all
            expenses related to the damage, injury, or trauma caused by any pets
            and/or animals to equipment, persons, or property of Lovely Real
            Estate Photography must be paid or reimbursed in full based on
            equipment and/or health-related services. Lovely Real Estate
            Photography will make efforts to contact the owner in this event,
            explain the matter, and bill the card on file respective to the
            damage caused.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lovely Real Estate Photography has the right to make decisions on
            behalf of the customer and its content. Customers that “opt-out” of
            certain services are at their own sole discretion, regardless of the
            bundle they purchase and the price paid for the service. Lovely Real
            Estate Photography is not held liable for the financial loss of its
            customers. No discounts or warranties will be granted in any event,
            unless directly stated by Lovely Real Estate Photography. Any claims
            or threats made to Lovely Real Estate Photography or its agents are
            deemed a violation of the agreement and policies, and Lovely Real
            Estate Photography can make its own viable decisions on a
            case-by-case scenario to ensure the safety and feasibility of its
            organization, employees, and agents.

            Clients booking on Lovely Real Estate Photography.com must assume
            all liability including but not limited to the case of theft,
            burglary, fire, damage, loss of contents, unlocked doors, death,
            rape, and injuries. Lovely Real Estate Photography is not liable for
            any of the above causes, as clients are hiring a contractor to enter
            their home at their own risk. Lovely Real Estate Photography ensures
            all of its staff, contractors, and third-party team members are
            processed through a rigorous background check, and ensures all
            members are free from criminal activity. Lovely Real Estate
            Photography is not liable for all of the following but not limited
            to theft, burglary, fire, damage, loss of contents, unlocked doors,
            death, and injuries.

            Information is requested from the site visitor on the online order
            form. Site visitors must create a confidential login profile, and
            provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and
            financial information (like credit card number, expiration date).
            This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customers
            {"' "}
            orders. If Lovely Real Estate Photography has trouble processing an
            order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the
            customer. Financial information relating to online credit card
            transactions processed online will be handled via our professional
            payment authorization service provider chosen for convenience,
            security, and reliability. For your security, Lovely Real Estate
            Photography does not maintain credit card information in its own
            databases or on its servers in respect of online transactions.
            Lovely Real Estate Photography does not store your credit card
            information. Online payments are passed via a secure socket layer to
            a payment processor where your information is tokenized (whereby a
            random number is generated to represent your payment). The payment
            processor is PCI compliant which ensures that your information is
            being handled in accordance with industry security standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purchase price and the credit card information collected on a
            secure site will be supplied and maintained in our professional
            payment authorization service provider’s database. This information
            is collected and encrypted via a secure server to ensure that others
            cannot read it. Once on the secure server, your credit card
            information is sent to a third-party intermediary for processing.
            All purchases are subject to municipal, provincial, and/or federal
            taxes of up to 15%. All purchases are subject to Online Merchant
            Processing Fees of 3% for credit card payments. All properties over
            4000 sq. ft. are charged at a different rate than under 4000 sq. ft.
            A detailed breakdown of the pricing is listed on
            lovelyrealestatephotography.com/pricing by toggling between under
            4000 sq. ft. and over 4000 sq. ft. The calculation of over 4000 sq.
            ft. is determined by “live-able spaces” which include but is not
            limited to the finished basement, main floor, second floor, and/or
            third & fourth floors. Upon booking the bundle, there is no option
            to select “over 4000 sq. ft.”, however, there is a checkbox for you
            to select if it is over 4000 sq. ft. to which you must select if it
            is. In the event your property is found to be over 4000 sq. ft., you
            will automatically be charged the going rate of the bundle ordered
            for properties over 4000 sq. ft. In the event you voluntarily
            withdraw from the service while the photographer is on-site, you
            will still be charged the full amount of the bundle since we have
            dedicated that time slot for your appointment upon booking. If you
            do not voluntarily identify your property as being over 4000 sq. ft.
            and we have found that it is in fact over 4000 sq. ft. through our
            floorplan calculator (including all livable floors, i.e., finished
            basement, main floor, second floor, and/or third & fourth floor),
            you will be automatically charged the going rate of the bundle
            originally selected in your booking for properties “over 4000 sq.
            ft.”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Access to the property must be granted for the full duration of the
            reserved photoshoot time, free and clear of personnel, barriers, and
            lockboxes. Doors that are set to auto-lock upon exiting must be
            changed in order to avoid access-related problems. In the event
            there is an access-related matter, any and all expenses pertaining
            to re-entry (albeit forced entry or locksmith) of the property are
            at the full expense of the customer who booked the appointment as it
            is their full responsibility to create an easy and safe environment
            for Lovely Real Estate Photography to enter/exit the premises.
